# soonseo
**soonseo** is a simple & extremely fast task queuing library for Java that leverages LMAX Disruptor and virtual threads to handle high-performance async tasks with minimal overhead.

## Features
- High throughput: Leverages the LMAX Disruptor for extremely fast and efficient event processing.
- Virtual threads support: Fully supports JDK 21+ virtual threads, providing lightweight concurrency with minimal resource usage.
- Configurable: Allows you to customize task queue behavior, including:
  - Task timeouts
  - Retry logic with configurable maximum retries
  - Error handling
  - Logging
  - Buffer size for task queuing
- Flexible task submission: Submit Runnable or Callable tasks for asynchronous execution.
- Graceful shutdown: Safely shut down the task queue without losing tasks in progress.
 

## Installation

To use soonseo in your project, add the following dependency to your Maven `pom.xml`:

### For maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.ian.soonseo</groupId>
    <artifactId>soonseo</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### For Gradle
```groovy
implementation 'org.ian.soonseo:soonseo:0.1.0'
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to configure and use soonseo

```java
TaskQueueConfig config = new TaskQueueConfig.Builder()
        .setMaxRetries(3)
        .setTaskTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
        .setEnableLogging(false)
        .setBufferSize(1024)
        .setErrorHandler(e -> System.err.println("Error occurred: " + e.getMessage())) // Custom error handler
        .build();

TaskQueue taskQueue = new AsyncTaskQueue(config);

// Submitting a simple task
taskQueue.submit(() -> {
// Task logic
});

// Shutting down the task queue
taskQueue.shutdown();
```

### Callable Example

If your task needs to return a result, you can submit a Callable and handle the result asynchronously
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = taskQueue.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return "Task Completed!";
});

try {
    // Wait for the result
    String result = future.get();
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
}
```

### Handling Task Timeouts

soonseo allows you to set a task timeout to automatically terminate tasks that exceed the specified duration
```java
TaskQueueConfig config = new TaskQueueConfig.Builder()
    .setTaskTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
    .build();

CompletableFuture<Void> future = taskQueue.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(5000);
    System.out.println("This line will not be reached due to the timeout.");
});

try {
    future.get();  // This will throw a TimeoutException
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
}
```
