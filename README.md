# soonseo
**soonseo** is a high-performance, lightweight task queuing library for Java that uses the LMAX Disruptor and virtual threads (JDK 21+) to provide asynchronous task processing. With low overhead and customizable retry logic, it's ideal for managing high-throughput task workloads with low-latency requirements.

## Features
- High throughput: Utilizes the LMAX Disruptor for low-latency, high-efficiency event processing.
- Virtual threads: Supports lightweight concurrency with virtual threads for scalable task processing.
- Configurable options:
  - Buffer size
  - Retry logic with customizable retry limits and backoff time
  - Task failure handling using custom exceptions
  - Worker metrics for monitoring task completion, failures, and retries
- Graceful shutdown: Ensures safe task queue termination with no loss of in-progress tasks


## Installation

To use Soonseo in your project, include the following dependency in your pom.xml (for Maven) or build.gradle (for Gradle)

### For maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.ian.soonseo</groupId>
    <artifactId>soonseo-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### For Gradle
```groovy
implementation 'org.ian.soonseo:soonseo-core:0.2.1'
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Below is an example demonstrating how to configure and use the **Soonseo** task queue

```java
Config config = new Config(1024, 2, 3, 100);  // Buffer size, 2 workers, 3 retries, 100ms backoff
Queue queue = new Queue(config);

Job job1 = new Job("Task1", "arg1,arg2", () -> {
  // Task logic goes here
});

queue.submit(job1);

try {
    queue.shutdown();
} catch (InterruptedException | TimeoutException e) {
    logger.error("Queue shutdown interrupted or timed out: ");
}
```

### Callable Example

If your task needs to return a result, you can submit a Callable and handle the result asynchronously
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = taskQueue.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return "Task Completed!";
});

try {
    String result = future.get();
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
}
```

### Handling Task Failures

In **Soonseo**, if a task throws an exception during execution, it will be marked as FAILED. You can use the job and worker metrics to track job status and retries.

```java
Job failingJob = new Job("TaskWithFailure", "arg1,arg2", () -> {
    throw new RuntimeException("Simulating a task failure");
});

try {
    queue.submit(failingJob);
} catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
}

// Capturing job metrics to check failure status
List<CapturedJobMetrics> jobMetrics = queue.captureJobMetrics();
jobMetrics.forEach(metric -> System.out.println("Job " + metric.key() + " status: " + metric.status()));
```

### Worker Metrics

You can track the performance of workers, including the number of jobs theyâ€™ve completed, failed, or retried

```java
List<CapturedWorkerMetrics> workerMetrics = queue.captureWorkerMetrics();
for (CapturedWorkerMetrics metrics : workerMetrics) {
    logger.info("Worker " + metrics.workerId() + " completed jobs: " + metrics.completed());
    logger.info("Worker " + metrics.workerId() + " failed jobs: " + metrics.failed());
    logger.info("Worker " + metrics.workerId() + " retried jobs: " + metrics.retried());
}
```

### Handling Task Retries

**Soonseo** allows you to configure retry behavior with an exponential backoff strategy. If a task fails due to insufficient buffer capacity, it will be retried up to the configured maximum retries.

```java
Job job2 = new Job("TaskWithRetry", "arg3,arg4", () -> {
    System.out.println("Job 2 executed");
});

queue.submit(job2);  // Job is retried if the buffer is full or capacity is unavailable
```
